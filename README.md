# What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
users can the resources like compute, storage, network from a cloud provider and deploy the applications instead of buying new servers and setting up in a data center.

This brings agility to an idea as procuring, installing and setting up the hardware/software is time taking and incurs cost.
