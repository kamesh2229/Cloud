# What is Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is on-demand delivery of IT resources over internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
users can the resources like compute, storage, network from a cloud provider and deploy the applications instead of buying new servers and setting up in a data center.

This brings agility to an idea as procuring, installing and setting up the hardware/software is time taking and incurs cost.

# Why we need cloud computing ?

Situation : Let us say some one have an idea of starting a new online business like a small fashon store that sells trendy oufits to different customers.. 

## What is needed here ?

1) A website that has details about the outfit
2) A physical server that can hold the website
3) A database to store the inventory, customer details etc
4) A DNS server mapping the domain name to the machine IP address
5) Some other needed..


## What is done next when there is no cloud provider ?

The person who got the idea need to start working on below things irrespective of having the situation if the idea will really work or not.

1) Buy a new machine (could be computer, a server etc)
2) Hire a person who can help in desigining the website 
3) A place where to install the server, maintain the server like cooling, power, power-backup, HW maintenance etc.
4) Buy a domain name for publishing the server IP to a general name like www.newfashions.com
5) Some more activity that are needed.

## What is needed here ?

The person needs investment which is money i.e first CAPEX captial expense and let us assume it is approximately $ 1000 for buying the servers, creating the website, power consumption etc..

## How much time it takes to launch the website ?

The time it takes to launch the website from the time the idea is ignited approximately takes 2 months considering with some good amount of cost involved by hiring people..

## What can happen when the website is launched i.e after 2 months the idea is ignited

1) The idea mighn't work as expected as it is outdated
2) There are already similar business that might have started couple of weeks back.
3) Other issues that arise might cause the business not to run as expected

## What is the impact ?
